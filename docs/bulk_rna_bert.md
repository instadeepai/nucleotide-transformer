# BulkRNABert

BulkRNABert is a transformer-based, encoder-only foundation model designed for bulk RNA-seq data. It learns biologically meaningful representations from large-scale transcriptomic profiles. Once pre-trained, BulkRNABert can be fine-tuned for various cancer-related downstream tasks, such as cancer type classification or survival analysis, by using its learned embeddings.

## Training data

The model was pre-trained on a large dataset of bulk RNA-seq profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.
The model takes as input sequences of 19062 gene expression. The gene ids that must be used and in which order they should appear in the sequence as provided in `../notebooks/data/bulkrnabert_gene_ids.txt`



## Training procedure

Following the original BERT framework, BulkRNABert uses a self-supervised, masked language modeling objective. During pre-training, gene expression values are randomly masked, and the model is tasked with reconstructing these values from their surrounding genomic context. This process enables the model to learn rich, contextual representations of transcriptomic profiles.
